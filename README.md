# Eloquent Javascript Solutions

Let's do Eloquent JavaScript

## Chapter 2

* [x] chess_board.js
* [x] looping_triangle.js
* [x] fizz_buzz.js

## Chapter 3

* [x] minimum.js
* [x] bean_counting.js
* [x] recursion.js

## Chapter 4

Concepts:

* Objects, arrays, weresquirrels.
* unary operators `delete`, `in`.
* mutable variables, immutable datatypes.
* way too cute correlation table example:
  * 2x2 truth table yields two-bit binary value -> four item array. (Allows for "if event i+=1" and "if otherEvent i+=2")
  * phi as a measure of correlation = (n11n00 -   n10n01)/sqrt(n1.n0.n.1n.0).
* shift/unshift = push/pop for beginning

Reading time ..

* [x] sum of a range
* [x] Reversing an array
* [x] a list .
* [x] deep comparison

## Chapter 5 - Higher Order Functions

* arrays and objects get `map`, `filter`, reduce
* functions get `apply` and `bind`, which remain kind of mysterious to me..

__Exercises__

* [x] flattening an array
* [x] mother/child age difference
* [ ] historical life expectancy
* [ ] every and then some
